# 10cancers
This repository contains the code and data necessary to implement a liquid biopsy method based on clinical laboratory data for the detection and classification of ten types of cancer. The project utilizes the Clinlabomics framework to promote the application of AI in clinical laboratory data analysis.
# Project Files
dataset/ : Contains the dataset used to train and test the model.
classification_indices.py: The script that calculates the classification evaluation results.
data_processing_new.py: script that processes the data set.
feature_process.py: A script for feature processing.
Main.py: The Main script that runs the model.
parameter_py.py: scripts for setting model parameters.
plot_figure. py: script for drawing results.

This project aims to contribute to the field of cancer detection and classification by leveraging AI and clinical laboratory data. We hope it serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.
